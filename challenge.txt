Model friend memberships to multiple circles

Social Circles help users organize their personal social networks. These are implemented as "circles" on Google+, and as "lists" on Facebook and Twitter. Each circle consists of a subset of a particular user's friends. Such circles may be disjoint, overlap, or be hierarchically nested.

The goal of this competition is to automatically infer users' social circles. You are provided a set of users, each of whose circles must be inferred. To do this, participants have access to:

1.	A list of the user's friends
2.	Anonymized Facebook profiles of each of those friends
3.	A network of connections between those friends (their "ego network")

To give you an idea of how to use this data, the problem of detecting social circles has been discussed (in an academic setting) in httpo://i.stanford.edu/~julian/pdfs/nips2012.pdf

Those of you who've been around Kaggle for a while may remember that we called upon you to create this data set. We extend our thanks to those of you who helped out. As a reward, you might be able to find yourself in the data and gain a one-row advantage?!
